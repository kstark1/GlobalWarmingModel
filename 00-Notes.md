## Naked Planet Model
Energy Equilibrium, Energy coming into the planet balances energy leaving the planet
Energy Out = Energy In


E_in (W) = L * (1 - albedo)/4 * A_shaddow
E_in is energy coming in from sun
albedo is reflection
L is solar constant

E_out (W) = epsilon * StefanBoltzman * T^4 * SA_Earth
epsilon = 1 if blackbody
E_out is energy going out from planet

__Naked Planet Model__
[L * (1 - albedo)]/4 = epsilon * StefanBoltzman * T^4

In reality, this model does not work, predicts too cold temperatures

## Greenhouse Effect Model 
The greenhouse gasses reflect back energy.
